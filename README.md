# CatHacks2022
This project is our teams 2022 Cat Hacks work. This is a website built in React and hosted on my github pages. 

UKonnect is a demo website meant to show off our work in React and design in CSS over the course of 48 hours. It is a website where local companies or organizations can post events to show off and allow students to more easily access that information.
